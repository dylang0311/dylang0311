# Dylan Green

I am a third-year PhD student in the mathematics department at Dartmouth College. My advisor is Dr. Anne Gelb.
My current research lies at the intersection of inverse problems and uncertainty quantification, with a focus on using empirical Bayesian inference in signal reconstruction.
The best way to contact me is by emailing me at Dylan.P.Green.GR@dartmouth.edu.
